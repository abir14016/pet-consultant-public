    "reviews": "My most favourite bike- the new royal enfield classic 350 made a fine attempt at dissuading me from riding anything else, And it succeeded to a fair extent, Too.Classic 300 is the important bike of the company.Previously these bikes had vibrations because of old engine.Now royal enfield has done great job by swapping a new non vibrating engine.Which attracts people to purchase the bike.It looks ve ry aggressive and stylish.\r\n",

Vroom it's been 1 year I am riding this machine. I took it for touring as well Almost covered 9k km on this. Words are not enough to explain. No other Indian made bike can cross you and it’s a beast with no experience.\r\n",

Before a trip a service is advised although, to ensure a safe and secure journey. Service is not usually required much. The riding comfort on trips will make you feel awesome.\r\n",

Gear changes is frequent as you can travel 40km/h in 3rd gear Cons- mileage 20km in city, heavy 210 kg with fuel. Stock ceat tyre's are tube type ( not tubeless like earlier firelli) so alloy wheel upgrade is more expensive.\r\n",

    "reviews": " have owned the bike for around a year now and hence am in a fairly good position to review the bike. The ownership experience has been satisfactory. This boils down to the largely trouble free nature of the machine. It is well engineered and well put together. The reliability has been stellar and have not faced any glitches except for a fogging instrument console. I raised it with HSR Services (authorized dealer for RE) and their team got it replaced in a day.\r\n",

I loved it by the looks and awesome styling, as there is more options for this cafe racer bikes, they don't have such great road presence, but well created. They are over priced according to Indian roads and rules. Only one thing i missed from interceptor 650 is led head lights and tail light.\r\n",

I will recommend this who want to go for long drives with comfortable seating and uninterrupted ride with a good service network of Royal enfield.. Trusted brand.\r\n",

I use it for daily commute, tours, traveling and weekend rides. I'm 163cm 65kg and little freak about speed. I ride the bike flawlessly it will always amaze me. All you need is better Practice and good Skills.3. Cool retro looks. Smooth engine and very good pickup.it will not hardly push till 170-180kmph, but it can keep you stay in 140-160kmph without any stress. Best sounding with Parellal twin.\r\n",
